# Part 4: Multi-page puzzles

When making a puzzle that's too large to fit on one page, obviously you can just divide up the pieces into multiple pages ... but we have to think about alignment error.

Adjacent pieces cut from the same page will have perfect alignment (relative to each other).  Pieces cut from different pages may not be perfectly aligned.

## How much error is typical?  How much is tolerable?

For the method described in this tutorial, I expect a cutting accuracy of 0.1â€“0.2mm, depending on the condition of your Glowforge.  In cutting two pages, the relative error can be double that, but usually it's within 0.2mm.  That's barely tolerable (see Q&A below), so we want to mitigate the error.

## How to mitigate the error

For most multi-page puzzles, you can get a good result by simply dividing up the puzzle strategically.  Keep in mind that a pair of adjacent pieces may be 

* **"Inseparable"** :  Misalignment will be noticed.  The cut goes through straight lines or edges, important details, people's faces, the main subject of the image.

* **"Separable"**:  Misalignment will be invisible or appear normal.  The cut goes through patches of open sky, fuzzy or grainy areas, grass, irregular jagged and broken lines or edges.

(Those aren't black-and-white categories, of course.)  Then, as much as possible:

1. By default, keep all of the pieces in the same relative position and orientation.  Don't rotate them.
2. For "inseparable" pairs, follow rule #1 strictly.
3. Never split "inseparable" pairs apart onto separate pages.  If this is impossible, find the split that will be the least noticeable.
4. Lay out your "separable" pieces last.  Because they can be moved around and rotated freely, you can use them to balance the number of pieces between pages, and to get everything to fit on the page.

Here's an example of what I did for this puzzle:

I broke the puzzle into four pages of equal area,

Then altered the split lines to avoid the ships, masts and sail lines (I couldn't entirely avoid splitting the horizon line),

and moved some unimportant pieces of sky around to re-balance the pages

To place the pieces onto the actual pages, I started with the important "inseparable" pieces, keeping adjacent pieces in their original relative positions,

Then filled in the "nooks and crannies" with the freely-movable "separable" pieces.

And that's ready to go!

## Q&A

### How much accuracy is actually required?

This is a hard question because it depends on 

* The resolution of the photo in its printed size.  Lower-resolution photos don't need as much accuracy.
* The size of the pieces.  A small misalignment will be more obvious in a 1/2" puzzle piece vs. a 1" puzzle piece.
* The presence of sharp edges and straight lines in the photo, especially at focal points such as people's faces or the picture's primary subject.  It's easy to spot a misalignment there.

As a rule of thumb, you probably want an error of 0.2mm (0.01") or less. Here's a picture showing errors of different sizes:
