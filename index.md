# A Technique for Accurate Laser Cutting on Upside-Down Digital Prints, Especially for Creating Zero-Kerf Jigsaw Puzzles

This method uses a Measurement and Alignment (MAP) sled, to get "naked-eye perfect" cut alignment.

## Q & A

#### What is this good for?
* Making kerf-adjusted puzzles
* Accurately outlining shapes from a picture
* Seamlessly joining halves of an oversized puzzle
* Cutting individual pieces (e.g. replacements)
* Scoring the back sides of prints, for origami fold lines.

#### What is "kerf" and "kerf-adjusted"?

"Kerf" is the gap made by the path of the laser cutter.  Like a saw, it destroys a path of material.  This leaves a gap between puzzle pieces so that they don't fit snugly â€” they wiggle a little loosely.  "Kerf adjustment" refers to slightly expanding the outline of the puzzle pieces to eliminate the gap, so that the pieces fit more tightly (and the picture looks better with less of it destroyed).  The only way to do this is by cutting the pieces individually.

#### Why cut upside-down?
Because in laser cutting, the kerf is always wider on top, narrower on the bottom.  For jigsaw puzzles, if you want the kerf reduced or eliminated on the front face, you need to cut it upside-down.

#### Is "naked-eye perfect" alignment even possible?
The short answer: Just barely ... usually ... depending on the use case. (I'll share the long answer later.)

For puzzles small enough to cut from a single page, the result generally appears perfect, because for adjacent pieces, small errors tend to cancel each other.
