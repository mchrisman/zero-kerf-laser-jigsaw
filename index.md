# A technique for accurate laser cutting on upside-down digital prints (especially for making kerf-adjusted jigsaw puzzles)

This method uses a Measurement and Alignment (MAP) sled, the goal being "naked-eye perfect" cut alignment.

## Tutorial

***Fair warning:**  the technique is simple, but it takes some patience and practice.  You should also anticipate that there will be some percentage of failures, damaged pieces that will need to be recut, especially if you're using an inkjet photo printer.*

## Q & A

#### What is this good for?
* Making kerf-adjusted puzzles
* Accurately outlining shapes from a picture
* Seamlessly joining halves of an oversized puzzle
* Cutting individual pieces (e.g. replacements)
* Scoring the back sides of prints, for origami fold lines.

#### What is "kerf" and "kerf-adjusted"?

"Kerf" refers to the gap or space created when a laser cutter cuts through material. "Kerf adjustment" refers to slightly expanding the outline of puzzle pieces to make them fit more closely together and eliminate the gap created by the laser cutter. This can only be done by cutting the pieces individually.

#### Why cut upside-down?
Because in laser cutting, the kerf is always wider on top, narrower on the bottom.  For jigsaw puzzles, if you want the kerf reduced or eliminated on the front face, you need to cut it upside-down.

#### Is "naked-eye perfect" alignment even possible?
The short answer: Just barely ... usually ... depending on the use case. (I'll share the long answer later.)

For puzzles small enough to cut from a single page, the result generally appears perfect, because for adjacent pieces, small errors tend to cancel each other.
