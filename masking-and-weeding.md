# Part 3: Masking and weeding

Here's my method for masking and weeding.   This part of the tutorial is in video form only.

## Materials

* Heavy (200gsm) letter-sized card stock
* Adhesive sheets (instant-sticking, **not** the pressure-sensitive kind) such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/BENECREAT-Double-Sheets-8-3x11-5-Adhesive/dp/B0866XJ84S/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4%3Aamzn1.sym.eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4&crid=3U74QPXJUGX4R&cv_ct_cx=double-sided%2Badhesive%2Bsheets&keywords=double-sided%2Badhesive%2Bsheets&pd_rd_i=B0866XJ84S&pd_rd_r=e78f8435-7dd9-404a-89a8-3c781455bc81&pd_rd_w=n4MNU&pd_rd_wg=QuFlA&pf_rd_p=eff26b9b-e255-411b-a40d-eccb21f93fe4&pf_rd_r=J9HMGCD3YHGDCTS78EYW&qid=1672700237&sprefix=double-sided%2Badhesive%2Bsheets%2Caps%2C130&sr=1-1-5985efba-8948-4f09-9122-d605505c9d1e&th=1)

Plus, of course, all the other materials needed for your puzzle as described in Part 1.

_An older version of this video dealt with the problem of inkjet photo paper sticking too strongly to the masking.  I no longer recommend using such paper, having found a better alternative, as mentioned in the video.  But if you want to watch the older video, it's here: [https://youtu.be/pxZ4Tgz4G1o](https://youtu.be/pxZ4Tgz4G1o).
